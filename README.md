# StarWarsLife
(Yet another) processing program that runs the "StarWars" variant of Generations Life.

`sketch_4statelife` is the main program: simulating any number of states of StarWars.

_Controls:_

* <kbd>space</kbd> - play/pause the sim
* <kbd>r</kbd> - restart with random cells
* <kbd>c</kbd> - clear the screen
* <kbd>z</kbd> - changes from additive to subtractive (hard to explain - just press z inside the sim and you'll see what I mean)
* <kbd>=</kbd> - speeds it up
* <kbd>-</kbd> - slows it down
* Click and drag anywhere - draw

`sketch_5statelife` was a fail at creating multiple states, but it looks cool
